## Introduction

Dragon Wars fan site. Dragon Wars is a fantasy role-playing video game.


It was developed by Rebecca Heineman and published by Interplay Entertainment and distributed by Activision in 1989.

The game was developed as a fusion of the Bard's Tale engine and Wasteland's design philosophy. 

With the possibility that Interplay would soon be parting ways with Electronic Arts, the design team decided to separate the game from the Bard's Tale name.

Released under the title of Dragon Wars, it was always considered a sequel to the Bard's Tale trilogy, and considered to be Bard's Tale IV. 

This site was created to as a shrine to Dragon Wars, and contains all the information you need to play and complete the game. 

And, since the game is no longer under copyright laws, you can even play the game in your browser window!
